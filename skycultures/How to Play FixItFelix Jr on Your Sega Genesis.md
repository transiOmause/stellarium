While the game was originally fictional, some fans have created their own versions of Fix-It-Felix Jr. for various platforms, including the Sega Genesis. In this article, we will show you how to download and play Fix-It-Felix Jr. on your Sega Genesis using an emulator.
 
## Step 1: Download the ROM file
 
A ROM file is a digital copy of a game cartridge that can be played on an emulator. You can find the ROM file for Fix-It-Felix Jr. for the Sega Genesis on Archive.org, a website that hosts free and legal downloads of various media. Here are two links to download the ROM file:
 
- [Fix-It-Felix Jr. (Genesis) by Airwalk Studios](https://archive.org/details/felix_bin)

Both versions are fan-made and may have some differences from the original arcade game. Choose the one you prefer and click on the download button to save the ROM file to your computer.
 
## Step 2: Download an emulator
 
An emulator is a software that mimics the hardware and software of a console, allowing you to play games on your computer. There are many emulators available for the Sega Genesis, but we recommend Kega Fusion, which is easy to use and compatible with most games. You can download Kega Fusion from this link:
